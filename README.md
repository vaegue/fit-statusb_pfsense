Dirty hack. Work in progress.
(don't hurt me, I'm learning)
Hopefully the start of a working [fit-statusb](https://fit-iot.com/web/product/fit-statusb/) plugin(ish) for pfSense.

This currently functions (pfSense 2.4.5, but it is ugly.
- no graceful start
- no graceful error handling (good LUCK!)
- requires `pkg install py37-serial` (pfsense)
